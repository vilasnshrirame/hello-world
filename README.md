# hello-world

Hi Humans,
I have a total of 2 years 10 months experience in ETL mapping and GCP(Google cloud platform) , used GCP for almost 2 + years now. before that we had a in-house ETL tool from which we extracted data by writing SQL views(queries which formed a particular structured data {table} and pulled the data from client sites) .
My secondary skills include Linux,bash scripting,python (Data science related),oops concepts(as a did my pg diploma in advanced computing CDAC). 
Looking forward to learning Python(In depth), Docker and Containers, kubernetes,AI,multi cloud environments (GCP,Azure,AWS)
Thank you.
